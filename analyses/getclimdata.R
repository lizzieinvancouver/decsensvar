## Hmm, these data are a hot mess. Is this really my best option?

## Next options ...
# I spent 30-60 mins with ChatGPT to get ideas, it led nowhere really ...
# We went around and around with getting data via NOAA nClimGrid-Daily
# but finally agreed with me that the API had changed and then it said it was now only online 1980+
# GPT claims that's the same year limit for PRISM so then we tried GHCN but my version of R does not suppport rnoaa 
# We tried GHCN and that just had so many issues, that I gave up. 

# I checked and PRISM does appear to drop out at 1981 for daily data
# I think our best bet is to use ERA or I could find an old harddive with the princeton data
# but that will end in 2006 or such I think (and is what we used in Nacho's paper, cite below)
