Wrong doomsday ...


To do: 
* Write up outline with sketches (see notes below)
* Get Auerbach daily data for lilac data from NPN see https://https-www-nature-com-443.webvpn.ynu.edu.cn/articles/sdata201538 (my notes say DOI 10.5061 and maybe dryad)


Notes:
* ESS for phenology (effective sample size, 80 days of climate versus 10 days ... 10 is not enough) 
* Autocorrelation (relates to above)
* Variance -- spatial variance each year could be totally different: one year everything goes at once (frost in France with grapes), the next year -- usual latitudinal gradient
* Calculate the probability of string of 80 F days in spring now versus 50 years ago
* CLT Breakdown
